## 🧭 Project Purpose

This tool was built for **office employees using a 3CX phone system** integrated with Microsoft 365, who:

* Have **automatic calendar integration enabled** in 3CX (via Microsoft Graph)
* Appear **“busy”** in 3CX during any Outlook appointment – even personal or self-created ones
* Want to remain **available for phone calls** despite having personal calendar events

By converting self-created busy events to **“free”**, users can:

* Keep their calendars intact
* Avoid call redirection or DND status in 3CX
* Maintain full control over availability for telephony
